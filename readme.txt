The codes are the supplementary codes in the paper: Robust Two-Layer Partition Clustering of Sparse Multivariate Functional Data.

The following Figures 1-9 are the corresponding figures in the aforementioned paper. The paper is available in Arxiv(https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.12135v1.pdf).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To obtain Figure 1, run elastic_time_distance_visualize.R

To obtain Figure 2, run cluster_example.R

To obtain Figure 3, run plot_scenario.R (for Figure 3 in the manuscript and other clustering scenarios in the Supplementary Material)

To obtain Figure 4, run plot_outlier_setting.R (for Figure 4 in the manuscript)

To obtain Figure 5, run plot_sparseness_setting.R (for Figure 5 in the manuscript)

To obtain Figure 6 & 7, run plotsimulation.R (we can also obtain the figures of the simulation performance for other scenarios, which are shown in the Supplementary Material)

To obtain Figure 8, run final_cyclone_00.R and final_cyclone_01.R 

To obtain Figure 9, run final_cyclone_02.R

In case you need help in the following items:
1. obtaining the original hurricane data (https://data.humdata.org/dataset/archive-of-global-tropical-cyclone-tracks-1980-may-2019)
2. running final_cyclone_00.R-final_cyclone_02.R

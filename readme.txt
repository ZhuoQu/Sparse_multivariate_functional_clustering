To obtain Figure 1, run elastic_time_distance_visualize.R

To obtain Figure 2, run cluster_example.R

To obtain Figure 3, run plot_scenario.R (for Figure 3 in the manuscript and other scenarios in the Supplementary Material)

To obtain Figure 4, run plot_outlier_setting.R (for Figure 4 in the manuscript and other outlier scenarios in the Supplementary Material)


To obtain Figure 5, run plot_sparseness_setting.R (for Figure 5 in the manuscript and sparseness settings under different scenarios in the Supplementary Material)

To obtain Figure 6 & 7, run plotsimulation.R (we can also obtain the figures of the simulation performance for other scenarios, which are shown in the Supplementary Material)

To obtain Figure 8, run final_cyclone_00.R

To obtain Figure 9, run final_cyclone_01.R

To obtain Figure 10, run final_cyclone_02.R
